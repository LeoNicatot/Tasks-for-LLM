In 1922, when Jung bought the property, he could not afford to take a vacation[^1]. Only one year earlier, in 1921[^2], he had published Psychological Types[^3], a seminal book[^4] that solidified many differences that had been long developing between Jungâ€™s thinking and the ideas of his onetime friend and mentor, Sigmund Freud. To disagree with Freud in the[^5] 1920s was a bold move[^6]. 

```python
if a == b and b == c:
    pass
```

`a == b` and `b == c`
